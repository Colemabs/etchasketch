A project to practice JavaScript and JQuery basics.
Basically a little notepad.

This project took me a few weeks working sparingly after work and on weekends, I estimate a total of 15 hours went into this project with research, learning, writing, and debugging. I learned a lot about CSS and it was nice to apply some programming logic for interactivity. I got to use the knowledge I've learned in CS classes at Miami as well as expand on my knowledge of CSS and design. There are undoubtedly mistakes and inefficiences in this project, but it was mostly just to get my feet wet in JS, JQ, and CSS. It's my first interactive web program that I built from scratch!
